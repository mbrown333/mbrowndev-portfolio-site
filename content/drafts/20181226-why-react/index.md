##Why React?

React is a popular UI library that was open sourced in Facebook back in 2013.  Since that time it has been adopted by many development teams for building applications.  Still wondering why it's so popular?  That's what I'll be discussing in this article.

###Developer Experience
* **Javascript vs Framework specific code**

I've used React in both personal and professional projects over the last couple of years so I've experienced first hand going through the initial learning curve and then using it to build various applications.  For me the number one benefit of using React is that it has made me a better Javascript developer.  The biggest contrast between React and other frameworks, like Angular, is that the frameworks take the approach of adding features to HTML so that it can do things that Javascript can already do like loops.  

React takes the approach of leveraging Javascript to build HTML templates using JSX which is very similar to HTML (although not exactly the same).  For other frameworks you'll be writing code that is very framework specific.  When I'm writing React I feel like I'm mainly just writing Javascript.

* **Small API**

React's API is *very* small.  So small in fact you can keep it all in your head.  React runs very close to the rails with Javascript so it mostly just leverages the power of JS.

* **Developer Tools**

There is great support for React developers through great tooling.  The best examples are Redux's time travel debugging and Create React app for quickly scaffolding out a new project.
